FAQ:

- Do I need to sign up for anything to use this application?
    - Zero signing up required.
    
- Is this application free to use?
    - Yes, it is completely free.

- Do I need to be in Window/Windowed Fullscreen to use this?
    - Yes. The application will not work in Fullscreen.
    
- Is this safe to use?
    - Yes. This application does not change or alter anything about the game or its files.
      Any information that is used for data purposes (I.E the Material Tracker Tool)
      comes from available API queries. 

- How do I know this won't give me a virus?
    - I wouldn't jepordize my reputation nor my ethics with embedding viruses in my application.
      Otherwise you can use services to scan the files for viruses,
      such as: <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/"> www.virustotal.com </a>
      I only host the installer download for my application here on my github page. 
      Please DO NOT download from anywhere else.
      
- Where can I report bugs/issues and/or request features?
    - Here on github: <a href="https://github.com/Michael-R-R/GW2_Hub/issues"> Github Issues </a>

- Why did you create this application?
    - It started as a simple 'Material Goal Tracker' console application example
      that I had used to help teach my significant other C++. I then later on
      decided to take that idea and flesh it out into a GUI application and it 
      quickly became a fun project to continue working on. 

- Do you plan on continuing support and updates for this application?
    - I still have a few ideas and a lot of quality of life 
      improvements that I would like to add. So, yes I do still 
      plan to support and improve this application as long as time allots.
      
- Will this application be perfect and bug free?
    - No, probably not. But, I believe it to be in a stable enough
      condition to finally release to to the public.
     
   Happy Gaming :)
