# Contributing

Hello there and thank you for taking interest in the GW2 Tool Hub application. By taking an interest in contributing to this project you are potentially helping the thousands of people that play Guild Wars 2 enchance their gameplay experience. Together we can create a rich and detailed Guild Wars 2 tool.

### The importance of these guidelines

These guidelines are in place to help me communicate to you what I expect from contributers and what contributers are to expect with contributing. Together we can respect each others time and develop the best application that we can together. These guidelines are not all encompassing, but rather a rough outline, which can grow or shrink depending on circumstances.

### What kind of contributions am I looking for?

- Documention for the application, such as simple tutorials.
- Help answering community questions.
- Submitting bug reports or feature requests.
- Bug squashing, such as fixing reported bugs in the GitHub issue tracker.
- Improving current features.
- Adding new features or extending previous features.

### What to keep in mind when contributing.

- Open source may not be something new to you, but it is for me and I am learning as I go. Please keep this in mind and be patient and respectful.
- As the solo maintainer for this project, please undestand I can deny any feature or change to the application. This is espeically true for any proposed changes that do not provide any documention or evidence of proper testing and compatibility. When proposing a new feature it is much more likely to be granted if you have enough documention and supporting evidence of said feature/change. 
- Be patient while waiting for contribution approval. This is a free open source project and it may take some time to respond to your contribution.
- Make me aware of what changes you are proposing to make in the GitHub Issue tracker. Provide as much information as possible.

# Ground Rules
### Expectations for behavior (mine, and yours).
This includes not just how to communicate with others (being respectful, considerate, etc) but also technical responsibilities (importance of testing, project dependencies, etc). Mention and link to your code of conduct, if you have one.

# Responsibilities
- Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage new contributors from all backgrounds.
- Be respectful to everyone.
- Test your code throughly.
- Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
- Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
- Don't be so serious. This project is meant to help people and I am open sourcing it so that others can come have fun helping to meet that vision.

# Your First Contribution

- Unsure where to start? Check the GitHub Issue tracker for any reported bugs or propose a small new change.
- Helpful tutorials: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/ and https://www.dataschool.io/how-to-contribute-on-github/
- Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://app.egghead.io/playlists/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).
> You're now ready to make some changes! If you're a beginner do not be afraid of helping out! We all have to start somewhere. I hope that everyone that contributes finds that they are having a fun and enjoyable time. Happy coding.

# Getting started
### General Guidelines

- For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:
>1. Create your own fork of the code
>2. Do the changes in your fork
>3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Send a pull request with detailed information.

# How to report a bug
### Security disclosures

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email me at gw2.tool.hub@gmail.com instead.
> In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
> * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
> * Can I disable something for other people?
>
> If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email me at gw2.tool.hub@gmail.com.

### How to file a bug report.

- When filing an issue, make sure to answer these three questions:
>
> 1. What did you do?
> 2. What did you expect to see?
> 3. What did you see instead?

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

Keep in mind when suggesting a feature the philosphy for this project, which is: Useful, applicable, and simple tools. This projects entire purpose is to give players an enhanced gaming experience by providing them a tool belt of various tools.

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include copy/pasteable snippets.
- Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
- Include screenshots and animated GIFs which help you demonstrate the steps.
- Explain why this enhancement/feature would be useful.

# Code review process

For the forseeable future I will sole reviewer of all Pull Requests and be the deciding factor in their approval. Please be patient while your Pull Request waits for approval. The more documention provide the faster the process.

# Code Style

### The few code styles I expect

- Functions: All words should be capitalized and brackets should follow, such as: 
> void YouAreAwesome()
> {
>   // Code
> }

- Variables: First word lowercase with the following being uppercase. If variable starts with an acronym make it all lowercase, if it is the last word make it all uppercase.
> bool isCool;
> std::string urlAdded;
> std::string addedURL;
> std::string someUrlAdded;

- Comment your code to be human readable and concise.
